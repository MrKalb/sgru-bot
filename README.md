# Chat by Vue + Webpack for SGRU 

Chat bot using Azure QnA and Vue for SGRU front-end application. 

Fork from [vue-chat](https://github.com/Coffcer/vue-chat/)

I remove the key to access the azure, so if you want to test it, build your own KB and QnA VM in Azure. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
